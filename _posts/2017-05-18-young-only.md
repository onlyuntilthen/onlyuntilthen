  <br/>So, I built a new blog...
  
  ...I've been meaning to get back into blogging for a while now but just never put the time and effort until now. There are 2 things I'd like to accomplish with this blog:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Document my travels and make a book out of it
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Make sure the blog stays under 1GB

<h2>The Makings of My First Book</h2>

  Since buying my Canon 7D back in 2010, I've been itching for a super compact digital camera. At the time, the technology wasn't there and when it was, it was super expensive. Wanting to take photography seriously, I got into analog, buying two Pentax Spotmatics off eBay. I learned a lot from using SLRs and applied this knowledge to my DSLR.
  
  One of my goals in life <em>was</em> to write and publish my own book. I say was because I have doubts with my descriptive writing abilities. I fashion my creative writing more so towards the "Wikis of imagined fictional history" - not sure if this style is meant for books. With that being said, one of my goals in life <strong>is</strong> to publish my own book. And I think photography is a quick and easy way to accomplish this. I love to travel and I think I got a pretty good eye when it comes to shooting stuff.
  
  However, as much as I love my 7D, I just hate the weight and bulkiness in carrying this huge piece of equipment. Every time I travelled, my 7D as well as my Spotmatics, would be collecting dust and I would end up using my iPhone to take pictures. I did get lots of great shots with my Spotmatic and I was about to start collecting these photos into a book but I just never got around to it.
  
  With that being said, I still do travel, whenever I can at least. I've pent up a lot with anxiety over the past few years and travelling is one of the best ways for me to cope with it. I'm headed to Hawaii this year with my girlfriend Kyrene and I plan to finally start shooting again this year. Still itching for a super compact camera, I opted for old compact point-and-shooters like the Olympus Stylus and Pentax Espio. I tested a few this passed winter and I'm still testing a few of them today. I'm also looking at the Ricoh GRii, a super compact digital camera with DSLR quality - which didn't exist back then but certainly does now!
  
  So yeah, I hope to turn this blog into an actual book or at least small volumes released once in awhile.

<h2>Under 1 Gigabyte</h2>

  Since I stopped blogging on hoodieandscarf, I quit my engineering job, opened my own clothing shop, learned web development, search engine optimization, search engine marketing and digital marketing in the process, lost a lot of money in trying to keep my shop running and ultimately, closed my shop for good due to failing miserably.
  
  I've always been a worry-warrior but I never knew just how far <strong>anxiety</strong> can fxck up your spirit...
  
   ...but through perseverance (and lots of prayers to the most High), I landed a job as an SEO engineer and slowly started getting out of this hole I got myself in.
  
  Due to these circumstances, I've been spending the last year and a half building myself back up, leveraging the lessons learned from my failures and helping other businesses succeed through digital marketing. Another outcome from this experience is that I've been a lot smarter with my money and unfortunately, with less of it. I'm a lot more frugal and calculated, mostly by necessity.
  
  So I built this blog using Github Pages and Jekyll. The repositories are limited to 1GB and with my frugalness past measurement, I'm going to try and keep this blog as super light as possible. I calculated that if I kept my posts to just under 8MB, I could probably yield 125 posts. Assuming I post twice to three times a month, this blog will last me about just under 4 to 5 years. Enough time, to make more loot and afford to actually use a proper CMS. 
  
  <strong>Yes, the frugalness is past measurement.</strong>. <em>Life, Life.</em>
  
  With 8MB a post, I could include a short write up and about 10 images max. Each image will unfortunately be compressed but still kept hopefully with 80% of the original's quality. 
  
  <h2>Welcome, welcome</h2>
  
  Alrighty, enough with the technical stuff. Welcome to my blog! I hope to get lots of material out for you and if you stick around long enough, you might just learn where the name "onlyuntilthen" came from. Thanks for reading!
